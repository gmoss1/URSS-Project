#Pipeline used to obtain parameters from KASOC-concatenated timeseries data  for sun-like stars. The methodology follows that described by Hekker et al.(2009) in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.2612.pdf         
First, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram is computed from the timeseries. The background is then fitted using two Harvey profiles*, in addition to instrument noise. Subtracting the background from the overall periodogram, the peak separation delta-nu is found, before the data is heavily smoothed to an excess-power hump, which is then fitted. The fit parameters are then used, along with the background parameters, as the initial guess for an MCMC algorithm which fits the entire periodogram simultaneously. The maxmimum mode amplitude can then be computed using the best MCMC result. The code computes the sph (photospheric activity index) and maximum mode amplitude for all the stars stored in the folder containing .fits files and summarises (and saves) the results to a table using python's pickle. The code takes roughly 10-15 minutes per star to run.
